## Project Setup

After cloning the repository, run the setup script to configure Git hooks:

```sh
./setup.sh
```

## To create a new migration file:
Use the same pattern as existing migration files in the `migrations` folder remembering to increment the number at the start of the filename accordingly (it should show the timestamp when the file was created, e.g., `20231010120000_add_new_table.sql`).
